<quote>We want to help JavaScript newcomers build a bridge, from being interested to contributing to the community, by introducing them to more experienced peers in a relaxed environment. If you feel you are committed to putting in the effort to learn JavaScript, we, in turn, are committed to helping you find the tools to do it –– in good company.</quote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/05/javascript-the-lingua-franca-of-the-web.html">has been said</a> to be the lingua franca (working language) of the Web. With the rising popularity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs">Node.js</a> for server-side programming, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">MongoDB</a> for document storage and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> for data interchange, JavaScript knowledge can be used in much more than just scripting Web sites.</p>
<p>The audience of HelsinkiJS has widened from just the professionals --- using it every day in their work --- even to people who've just heard about JavaScript and want to learn more. For this part of the audience, talks about JS-related frameworks or specific features of the language might be a bit daunting at first. How could those people be helped to join the community so that they, too, could some day contribute?</p>
<p>We want to help build that bridge for people committed to delve deeper into the world of JavaScript. From our experience it is obvious that nothing can replace the mental work that is needed to get familiar with the logic and basic concepts of any programming language. However, it is not all the same in what context you do that work. We think that a balance of commitment to hard work and a supportive community yields the best results in getting started quickly with any language.</p>
<p>The idea of HelsinkiJS PeerProgramming is to introduce dedicated JavaScript newcomers with more advanced peers who still have their first steps relatively fresh in their memory, and seasoned JavaScript professionals from whom to ask for additional information. This is a great change for the more experienced peer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching">learn by teaching</a>.</p>
<p>The premise for this to work is that all attendees have a strong commitment to doing the individual work needed for real learning to occur. This is why attendees need to first complete the interactive <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript-upgraded">JavaScript Fundamentals course (free) on CodeAcademy</a> first, which represents the "preparation at home" part of learning by teaching.</p>
<h2>If you are willing to take on the challenge of learning JavaScript, you now have a clear path for it.</h2>
